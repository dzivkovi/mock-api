# UVX Packaging Solution for Cross-Platform MCP

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-09 11:00 PM  
**Context:** Demo preparation - resolving Windows/WSL virtual environment compatibility issues

## The Question/Query

User encountered a critical error when trying to run the Teamcenter MCP server from Windows Continue.dev accessing WSL files:

**Error**: `Project virtual environment directory \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\daniel\work\mock-api\.venv cannot be used because it is not a valid Python environment (no Python executable was found)`

User asked: "Do I simply replace those values or I have to build packages? Teach me how to do it but not do it - I would like to wrap up the night."

## Analysis and Findings

### Root Cause Identification

The fundamental issue is a **Windows/WSL Python environment incompatibility**:

- WSL Ubuntu `.venv` contains **Linux Python binaries** 
- Windows Continue.dev cannot execute Linux binaries
- When Windows tries to run `uv run python auth_mcp_stdio.py`, it fails to find a valid Windows Python executable in the WSL virtual environment

### UVX as the Solution

**What UVX is:**
- **Like NPX for Python** - runs packages in isolated temporary environments
- **No pre-existing virtual environment needed** - creates its own
- **Cross-platform compatible** - works same way on Windows/WSL/Linux
- **Package-focused** - installs and runs Python packages directly

**Why UVX Solves This:**
```bash
# Instead of this (broken):
uv --directory \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\... run python auth_mcp_stdio.py

# UVX would do this (works):
uvx teamcenter-mcp-server --base-url http://localhost:8000
```

### Cannot Simply Replace Values

**Answer**: You **cannot simply replace values** because `uvx` expects a **real Python package**, not a loose script file.

**Current**: `auth_mcp_stdio.py` (just a script file)  
**Target**: `teamcenter-mcp-server` (installable package)

### Build Process Overview

**1. Create package structure**:
```
teamcenter-mcp/
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml          # Package definition
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ teamcenter_mcp/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ server.py       # Your auth_mcp_stdio.py code
```

**2. Add console script entry point** in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.scripts]
teamcenter-mcp-server = "teamcenter_mcp.server:main"
```

**3. Build and install**:
```bash
pip install -e .          # Local development install
# OR
pip install teamcenter-mcp-server  # From PyPI later
```

### End Result Transformation

**Instead of this (broken)**:
```json
"command": "uv",
"args": ["--directory", "\\\\wsl.localhost\\Ubuntu\\...", "run", "python", "auth_mcp_stdio.py"]
```

**You get this (works everywhere)**:
```json
"command": "uvx",
"args": ["teamcenter-mcp-server", "--base-url", "http://localhost:8000"]
```

### Tomorrow's Implementation Plan

1. **Package the MCP server** (30 minutes)
2. **Test with UVX** (5 minutes)  
3. **Update configs** (5 minutes)
4. **Demo ready!** ðŸš€

## Key Insights

- The packaging is straightforward - mostly moving files around and adding a `pyproject.toml`
- UVX eliminates virtual environment compatibility nightmares entirely
- This aligns perfectly with the "universal MCP server solution" documented in finding #08
- The approach provides true cross-platform compatibility without path/environment dependencies

## Conclusion

UVX packaging is the definitive solution for cross-platform MCP server deployment, eliminating the fundamental Windows/WSL Python environment incompatibility that caused the original error. The packaging process is manageable and results in a professional, distributable solution.

# UVX Wheel Deployment Breakthrough

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-09 10:39 AM  
**Context:** Solving Windows/WSL virtual environment incompatibility for Continue.dev MCP integration

## The Question/Query

User encountered Windows/WSL Python environment incompatibility with Continue.dev configuration:

```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "modelContextProtocolServers": [
      {
        "transport": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "uv",
          "args": ["--directory", "\\\\wsl.localhost\\Ubuntu\\home\\daniel\\work\\mock-api", "run", "python", "auth_mcp_stdio.py", "--base-url", "http://localhost:8000"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Error**: WSL virtual environment directory cannot be used because Windows Continue.dev cannot execute Linux Python binaries.

User asked: "What is absolutely simplest way to deploy this package publicly so these directory are causing continue.dev setting to not work?"

## Analysis and Findings

### Root Cause
- **Windows Continue.dev** trying to access **WSL Ubuntu .venv**
- Linux Python binaries incompatible with Windows execution environment
- Cross-platform virtual environment conflict

### UVX as the Ultimate Solution

**Discovery**: We already had everything needed for UVX deployment in our simplified solution.

**Key Insight**: The `pyproject.toml` with console script entry point was already configured:

```toml
[project.scripts]
teamcenter-mcp-server = "auth_mcp_stdio:main"

[tool.setuptools]
py-modules = ["auth_mcp_stdio"]
```

### Implementation Results

**Built package successfully:**
```bash
uv build
# Created: dist/teamcenter_mcp_server-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

**Tested UVX execution:**
```bash
uvx --from dist/teamcenter_mcp_server-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl teamcenter-mcp-server --version
# Output: teamcenter-mcp-server 0.1.0
# Installed 45 packages in 93ms
```

### Ultra-Simple Solution

**Replace broken Continue.dev config with:**
```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "modelContextProtocolServers": [
      {
        "transport": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "uvx",
          "args": ["--from", "\\\\wsl.localhost\\Ubuntu\\home\\daniel\\work\\mock-api\\dist\\teamcenter_mcp_server-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl", "teamcenter-mcp-server", "--base-url", "http://localhost:8000"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Why This Solves Everything

1. **No virtual environment dependency** - UVX creates its own isolated environment
2. **No Windows/Linux binary conflicts** - UVX handles cross-platform compatibility  
3. **Same wheel works everywhere** - Windows, WSL, Linux, macOS
4. **Ultra-simple deployment** - just copy the `.whl` file anywhere
5. **No PyPI publishing required** - wheel file IS the distributable package

### Deployment Simplicity

**For any machine:**
```bash
# Just copy the wheel file and use:
uvx --from teamcenter_mcp_server-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl teamcenter-mcp-server --base-url URL
```

## Key Insights

1. **Perfect Timing**: The simplification work earlier set up the exact structure needed for UVX
2. **Elegant Solution**: One command builds it (`uv build`), one command uses it anywhere (`uvx --from`)
3. **Zero Infrastructure**: No PyPI, no servers, no complex deployment - just a wheel file
4. **Universal Compatibility**: Solves Windows/WSL/Linux/macOS compatibility in one stroke

## Conclusion

The UVX wheel deployment represents the ultimate simplification:
- **Build once**: `uv build` creates universal wheel
- **Deploy anywhere**: Copy `.whl` file 
- **Use everywhere**: `uvx --from wheel-file command`

This breakthrough eliminates all virtual environment compatibility issues while maintaining the "Less is More" design principle. The solution is so simple it's almost invisible - exactly what great engineering should be.

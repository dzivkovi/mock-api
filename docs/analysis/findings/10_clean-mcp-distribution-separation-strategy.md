# Clean MCP Distribution Separation Strategy

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-09 11:05 PM  
**Context:** Demo preparation - clarifying package distribution scope and separation concerns

## The Question/Query

User asked: "Will my mock-api server get in the way of creating a clean distribution? I don't need to distribute mock-api Just the MCP"

## Analysis and Findings

### Clean Separation Confirmed

**Answer**: No, Mock-API won't get in the way! The separation is actually ideal for clean distribution.

### Distribution Scope

**What You'll Package:**
- **ONLY the MCP server** - a standalone Python package that:
  - Takes `--base-url` argument for any API endpoint
  - Can connect to ANY Teamcenter-compatible API
  - No dependency on your mock-api code

### Project Structure Separation

```
teamcenter-mcp/                  # ← Package this
├── pyproject.toml
├── src/
│   └── teamcenter_mcp/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── server.py            # ← Enhanced auth_mcp_stdio.py

mock-api/                        # ← Keep this separate (demo only)
├── main.py                      # ← Your FastAPI mock server
├── tests/
└── README.md
```

### Universal Configuration Magic

**The package will work universally:**
```bash
# At home (demo):
uvx teamcenter-mcp-server --base-url http://localhost:8000

# At work (production):
uvx teamcenter-mcp-server --base-url https://real-teamcenter-api.company.com
```

### Distribution Benefits

- **Clean**: No mock-api dependencies
- **Portable**: Works with any Teamcenter API
- **Professional**: Proper Python package
- **Configurable**: `--base-url` makes it universal

## Key Insights

1. **Perfect Separation**: The mock-api stays in your demo repo, but the **MCP server becomes a reusable tool**
2. **Universal Compatibility**: The `--base-url` argument makes the MCP server work with any Teamcenter-compatible API
3. **Professional Distribution**: The package follows proper Python packaging standards
4. **Demo vs Production**: Same MCP server package works for both environments with different URLs

## Conclusion

The separation strategy is optimal - the mock-api serves as a development/demo tool, while the MCP server becomes a standalone, distributable package that can connect to any Teamcenter API. This provides the cleanest possible distribution without any unnecessary dependencies.
